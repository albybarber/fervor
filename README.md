Molecule
----

*Current status*: Just in a demo state right now. 

Potentially a framework for people who want batteries to be included in their frameworks. I set this repo up in order to learn more about relay/graphql. I found some cool libraries in the eco-system, now I'm just pulling everything together.

Goals:
----

1. work fullstack (data through front-end)
2. have solutions for common web-dev problems
3. universally render apps
4. should work out of the box
5. magical but explicit

How to Run the Example?
---

1. create a database in postgres, copy the migration from the basic app and run it
2. add a couple rows in the db for the person table
3. yarn install
4. run `lib/molecule examples/basic` or `lib/molecule-debug examples/basic`
